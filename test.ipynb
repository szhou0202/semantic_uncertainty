Botulinum toxin is made up of just two ordinary proteins joined together by easily broken chemical bonds—sulfur-to-sulfur bonds between cysteine amino acids in two proteins (Ingraham, p.234). The heavier protein is responsible for seeking and finding the exact spot where nerves contact muscles. When botulinum toxin arrives at this critical junction, a lighter protein that is a protein-destroying enzyme called protease attacks the neuromuscular junction. Consequently, when the neuromuscular junction is destroyed, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine cannot bind to it. Botox works by neuromuscular inhibition of acetylcholine.

The Ray’s Jazz has faced many changes since its founder Ray Smith started to spread the jazz music word in the 70s with his vinyl record shop in the basement of a store on Oxford Street . Later on the small shop was moved and sold to Foyles bookshop in 2002 and placed on the first floor of the old Charing Cross Road branch. Today, with its new location, Ray’s Jazz has found a perfect combination to make the transposition of the music it promotes into an immediate live music experience. Just imagine heading into a shop to buy some books and then finding yourself in a totally unexpected situation. During coffee breaks or happy hour this outlet gives you the chance to pop into a jazz concert and take a welcome break from your shopping.

[PAR] Matilda had already achieved a moderate amount of success against her cousin, which had been countered by a fair amount of failure. Henry’s mother and her forces had first landed in England in 1139 in an attempt to take advantage of Stephen’s failures as a king. Setting up her headquarters at Bristol, Matilda and her half-brother proceeded to win over several influential barons to their cause and were able to capture a number of castles throughout southern England (northern England, at the time, was largely in the possession of Matilda’s uncle, King David I of Scotland). As the civil war raged on, the Angevins were able to achieve their most significant victory at the Battle of Lincoln, where they routed the royal forces and took Stephen himself captive. Matilda then had herself proclaimed Queen of England, but was unable to win over any vast amount of support for her newly established regime and was never even crowned or anointed. The royal forces countered their loss at Lincoln by decisively defeating Matilda’s army at Winchester, capturing Gloucester in the process. Matilda had no choice but to exchange Stephen for her brother. Stephen was back on his throne, but the struggle between the two factions continued, with neither side gaining any real ground. ',\n",

There are many fine studies of Gall by German scholars;      these do not easily suit the needs of the wider historiography of Anglo-American      phrenology, however. The histories of Gall and of phrenology are two different      books, distinct and often contradictory. Hence this account is not simply      a summary of German Gall research. Instead, the German beginnings of Gall's      science are considered from a perspective useful for understanding the specific      cultural origins of what became phrenology in the English-speaking world. \",\n",

The name “dungarees” is a relic of the British colonial presence in India. “Dungri” was the Hindi name of a particular type of thick, durable cotton cloth exported from India to England in the 18th century, originally used to make sails and tents. Eventually “dungri” cloth was pressed into service in the manufacture of work clothes, gained an extra syllable in its name, and became “dungaree.” [PAR] I doubt that if you were to wander into the average American department store today and ask for a pair of “dungarees” that the clerk would know where to look, but while the term has definitely faded on this side of the Atlantic, it seems to have acquired a new meaning in Britain.

[PAR] Capp was born Alfred Gerald Caplin in New Haven, Connecticut, on September 28, 1909. Twelve years later he lost most of his right leg in a streetcar accident, an event which did not interrupt his progress as a student of drawing—self-taught in his early days. Capp married Catherine Wingate Cameron in 1929 while he was wending his way through a chain of art schools. After working for other cartoonists, Capp launched his own strip in 1934, succeeding on his first try. \"Li\\'l Abner\" was carried by only eight newspapers at the outset but soon became wildly popular. Before long it was giving Capp a yearly income of 150,000 solid gold depression-era dollars.

Lawrence    was an authority on the history of the crusades, military history and archaelogy,    and an expert in guerilla warfare who was well- versed in intelligence operations.    His character provoked varying responses, and he seemed to be at once regarded    as self-aggrandizing and self-effacing; a man who \"backed into the limelight\",    but wrote poetry and essays, often requesting that his name not appear on his    published work. He translated from Greek and French; and for a time he reviewed    books regularly for a weekly journal. As his efforts towards the production    of Seven Pillars of Wisdom suggests, Lawrence had a love for books and    for printing and had hoped to have his own press after he retired from the military.

[PAR] It’s no exaggeration to say that Noises Off may very well be the greatest farce written in the modern day. Not only is the play side-achingly funny, but it is also structurally impeccable – and neither of these are easy feats. Michael has put exactly the right combination of characters onstage together to create maximum mayhem, with feats of verbal and physical dexterity coming at a non-stop pace as egomaniacs clash with beleaguered fixers and vanity is forced to take a backseat. This play has more intricate choreography than you’ll find in most musicals, with the complicated action keeping everyone on their toes (or falling down on other parts of their bodies). As our director Jeremy Herrin has put it, Michael’s stage directions for the play are simply “magisterial” – his is the guiding hand keeping all of the chaos in motion, making an incredibly complex map of interactions somehow seem effortless, uproarious, and even inevitable.

Jerome of a boating holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford. The book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages seem a distraction to the comic novel. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers - the jokes seem fresh and witty even today. The three men are based on Jerome himself (the narrator J.) and two real-life friends, George Wingrave (who went on to become a senior manager in Barclays Bank) and Carl Hentschel (the founder of a London printing business, called Harris in the book), with whom he often took boating trips. The dog, Montmorency, is entirely fictional but, \"as Jerome admits, developed out of that area of inner consciousness which, in all Englishmen, contains an element of the dog.\" The trip is a typical boating holiday of the time in a Thames camping skiff. This was just after commercial boat traffic on the Upper Thames had died out, replaced by the 1880s craze for boating as a leisure activity. ',\n",

In a career spanning over 40 years, he is probably best known for his suspense and crime thriller films, including such box office successes as Carrie, Dressed to Kill, Scarface, The Untouchables, and Mission: Impossible. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, De Palma worked repeatedly with actors Jennifer Salt, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen (his wife from 1979 to 1983), Gary Sinise, John Lithgow, William Finley, Charles Durning, Gerrit Graham, cinematographers Stephen H.

Before I answer that, here's my  quick guide to Shakespeare. [PAR] One of the greatest ever writers of the English language was William  Shakespeare. He was born on 23rd April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, England and during his life,  wrote about 154 poems (called sonnets) and 38 plays. From 1588, he lived in London where many of his  plays were performed in front of the courts of the Royal Family. Although his plays are now over 400  years old, they are still performed and studied today, containing themes and ideas which are as relevant  now as they were when they were first written. The Globe Theatre in London was opened in 2000 and is a  modern day replica of the type of theatre in which Shakespeare's plays would have originally been  performed. Some of Shakespeare's most famous plays are Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Hamlet and A Midsummer  Night's Dream. Shakespeare died on 23rd April 1616 and is buried in Stratford-upon-Avon church. Although Shakespeare wrote a large number of plays, these plays can be placed into four categories: Comedies, Histories, Tragedies and Romances. \",\n",

It is that witty, despite the occasional Hollywood flourish and old-fashioned mores that one might be inclined to assign to Norman.

The stones typically come in a rectangular block about an inch thick and can be made out of material such as diamond, ceramic and natural sharpening stones from Arkansas.

One of the major advantages is that the stones can be used on many other steel products, including scissors, razors and tools with larger blades.

That job should be left to a different method like a sharpening stone or an electric knife sharpener. Sharpening steels are long, narrow rods made out of steel or ceramic.

Olivier Py's staging, a coproduction with La Monnaie in Brussels, had its French premiere on March 14 at Opéra du Rhin in Strasbourg, conducted by Daniele Callegari. [PAR] Py believes in this sprawling five-act opera, wholeheartedly embracing the work's libretto and its religious confrontation between Huguenots and Catholics. Pierre-André Weitz's raked metallic stage relied on strong lighting to make its points and was more evocative of a Py\\xad–Weitz production than of any anecdotal historical backdrop. There were plenty of the director's familiar mannerisms to love or hate, including gratuitous nudity and an awkward exploration of physicality that would no doubt have surprised Meyerbeer and his librettist. Py is a consummate professional, however: it would be hard to imagine another director who could bring such playful dramatic energy to the work. The only added symbol, which could have been left to the audience's imagination, was the Holocaust reference at the moment of the final massacre of the Protestants.

It was conquered by the Romans during the reign of Augustus, and awarded city rights in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, Frankish Empire, Bulgarian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary before it became the capital of Serbian king Stephen Dragutin (1282–1316). In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo.

[PAR] Purpose [PAR] The reason that the country only has one time zone is both practical and political. The Communist party established the country's current time system shortly after it founded the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 to streamline operations, but also to make the country appear more unified. This was a strongly political move, since the country is so large and consists of many regions and ethnic minorities, and it has historically been difficult for one power to effectively rule over all the different areas. It was particularly important to establish authority over the entire country in 1949, as it had been divided by civil war for over 20 years and had gone through a period of fragmentation before that. [PAR] Practical Concerns [PAR] Having only one official time does cause practical problems, especially for people in the western provinces. Beijing is about 3.5 hours ahead of the far Western provinces, meaning that in some cases, the official time is already 10 AM when the sun rises in places like Xinjiang and Tibet. Since many of the people in those provinces are ethnic minorities, they sometimes feel that the use of BST is oppressive and unnecessary. Additionally, many farming communities throughout the country just use their own times, since agricultural work has to be done when the sun is out, regardless of the official time [PAR] Exceptions [PAR] Hong Kong and Macau both use their own time, called Hong Kong Time (HKT) and Macau Standard Time (MST), both of which are Coordinated Universal Time, plus 8 hours (UTC+8).

In honour of Helios, Panhellenic games, the Halieia, were held on the island every five years, and each year a chariot and four horses (quadriga) were thrown into the sea as an offering to the god (who was believed to ride such a chariot across the sky each day).

Rather than showing people doing fun and/or incredible things while drinking the product or having celebrity endorsements, Sprite decided to focus on buying Sprite because it will quench your thirst. The new tv spots were fashioned as what Sturken & Cartwright call \"anti-ads\"(p.296).

This classic is presented as a wonderfully presented edition with a fully interactive table of contents. [PAR] The Prince of Abissinia: A Tale, though often abbreviated to Rasselas, is an apologue about happiness by Samuel Johnson. The book\\'s original working title was \"The Choice of Life\". He wrote the piece in only one week to help pay the costs of his mother\\'s funeral, intending to complete it on 22 January 1759 (the eve of his mother\\'s death). The book was first published in April 1759 in England. Johnson is believed to have received a total of £75 for the copyright. The first American edition followed in 1768. The title page of this edition carried a quotation, inserted by the publisher Robert Bell, from La Rochefoucauld: \"The labour or Exercise of the Body, freeth Man from the Pains of the Mind; and this constitutes the Happiness of the Poor\". [PAR] Johnson was influenced by the vogue for exotic locations. He had translated A Voyage to Abyssinia by Jeronimo Lobo in 1735 and used it as the basis for a \"philosophical romance\".

The Barbizon school was active roughly from 1830 through 1870. It takes its name from the village of Barbizon, France, near the Forest of Fontainebleau, where many of the artists gathered. Some of the most prominent features of this school are its tonal qualities, color, loose brushwork, and softness of form.  [PAR] History [PAR] In 1824 the Salon de Paris exhibited works of John Constable, an English painter. His rural scenes influenced some of the younger artists of the time, moving them to abandon formalism and to draw inspiration directly from nature. Natural scenes became the subjects of their paintings rather than mere backdrops to dramatic events. During the Revolutions of 1848 artists gathered at Barbizon to follow Constable's ideas, making nature the subject of their paintings. The French landscape became a major theme of the Barbizon painters.  [PAR] The leaders of the Barbizon school were Théodore Rousseau, Jean-François Millet, and Charles-François Daubigny; other members included Jules Dupré, Constant Troyon, Charles Jacque, Narcisse Virgilio Díaz, Pierre Emmanuel Damoye, Charles Olivier de Penne, Henri Harp\",\n",

It is the addition of a minimum of 12% chromium to the steel that makes it resist rust, or stain 'less' than other types of steel. The chromium in the steel combines with oxygen in the atmosphere to form a thin, invisible layer of chrome-containing oxide, called the passive film. The sizes of chromium atoms and their oxides are similar, so they pack neatly together on the surface of the metal, forming a stable layer only a few atoms thick. If the metal is cut or scratched and the passive film is disrupted, more oxide will quickly form and recover the exposed surface, protecting it from oxidative corrosion . [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] (Iron, on the other hand, rusts quickly because atomic iron is much smaller than its oxide, so the oxide forms a loose rather than tightly-packed layer and flakes away.) The passive film requires oxygen to self-repair, so stainless steels have poor corrosion resistance in low-oxygen and poor circulation environments. In seawater, chlorides from the salt will attack and destroy the passive film more quickly than it can be repaired in a low oxygen environment.

It covered birth, marriage, and death, burial, and cremation ceremonies, weapons and feasting, travelling, land-taking, and the making of oaths between men. The famous weapon of Thor was not only the symbol of the destructive power of the storm, and of fire from heaven, but also a protection against the forces of evil and violence. Without it Asgard could no longer be guarded against the giants, and men relied on it also to give security and to support the rule of law.[7] [PAR] Of all of these consecration ceremonies, the use of the hammer to bless a marriage is especially well-established. The existence of this rite is assumed in the tale of Thor as a Transvestite , where the giants stole Thor’s hammer and he went to retrieve it by dressing as a bride to be married to one of the giants, knowing that the hammer would be presented during the ceremony. When it was presented, he seized it and promptly smashed the skulls of all of the giants in attendance.

The Althingi had been abolished in 1800 but was reestablished in 1843 as a consultative assembly. In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland home rule in 1874, which again was extended in 1904. The constitution, written in 1874, was revised in 1903, and a minister for Icelandic affairs, residing in Reykjavik, was made responsible to the Althingi. The Act of Union, a 1918 agreement with Denmark, recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign state united with Denmark under a common king. Iceland established its own flag and asked that Denmark represent its foreign affairs and defense interests.

Although an individual’s skin colour is influenced by numerous factors, the most significant is its content of a pigment called melanin. Melanin is also the pigment responsible for determining hair and eye colour. [PAR] Levels of melanin are primarily determined by genetics; individuals born to fair skinned parents will inherit their parent’s fair skin, as individuals born to dark skinned parents will inherit dark skin. The level of inherited skin pigmentation is referred to as constitutive pigmentation. A number of other factors determined at birth, for example the way a person’s body produces hormones and the way these hormones signal the cells which produce melanin, also influence skin colour. These factors inherited at birth, which cannot be changed, are referred to as intrinsic factors. [PAR] Extrinsic factors, things outside the body, also influence skin colour and provide acquired pigmentation. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is the most important extrinsic factor. The sun emits UVA and UVB rays and the different types of UV rays have different effects on skin pigmentation. Exposure to UVA rays produces immediate pigmentation by influencing melanin which has already been produced and is waiting in the skin’s upper layers. Pigmentation which occurs several days after sun exposure is a result of new melanin being produced in response to UVB exposure. Other extrinsic factors which influence skin pigmentation and colour include DNA damage (often induced by UVB exposure) and age, as the way the body produces melanin changes as a person ages. ',\n",

When the must weight reaches 19 to 23 °Bé the juice is extracted thorough crushing and pressing.

It is the active ingredient in agricultural lime, and is usually the principal cause of hard water. Calcium carbonate is commonly used medicinally as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, but excessive consumption can be hazardous. The main use of calcium carbonate is in the construction industry. It is used in the oil industry in drilling fluids as a formation bridging and filtercake sealing agent and may also be used as a weighting material to increase the density of drilling fluids to control downhole pressures. It  is widely used as an extender in paints and as a filler in plastics. It is also used in adhesives, sealants, and decorating fillers.

Current violin teachers have a large responsibility to pass on to their students a strong foundation of technique and musicianship so that one day the students will be able to adequately teach both themselves and their own future students. Because of this responsibility, it is important for the violin teacher to be able to adequately pass on information in variety of ways in order to suit each individual student, thus enabling every student to gain something from their violin studies. A thorough understanding of the history of violin pedagogy is imperative to being an effective teacher. There have been many great violin pedagogues through the history of the violin, along with many important treatises on both playing and teaching the violin.

After its original capital, Belize City , was ravaged by a hurricane in 1961, a new capital, Belmopan , was built inland, about 50 miles (80 km) west of Belize City, which remains the country’s commercial and cultural centre as well as its most populous city.

It was refined over the next 47 years until a design by Kenworthy and Bullough made the operation completely automatic (the Lancashire Loom). [PAR] The power loom reduced demand for skilled handweavers, initially causing reduced wages and unemployment. Protests followed its introduction. For example, in 1816 two thousand rioting Calton weavers tried to destroy power loom mills, and stoned the workers.  A darker side of the power loom’s impact was the growth of employment of children in power loom mills. [PAR] Relation to Textiles: [PAR] Much like the water frame did for spinning, the power loom started automating the process of weaving, though it was a long time until the power loom was fully automatic. [PAR] Cartwright’s initial version of the loom was not very commercially successful, but by the 1850s, there were a quarter of a million looms operating in the UK, compared to the 240 that were operating in 1803. [PAR] Of course, the power loom, like many of the innovations in weaving, caused a number of riots, and several machines were smashed by workers; eventually, however, the growth in weaving caused a growth in exports and thus a growth in industrial employment, albeit lower-paid employment.

The major components of the loom are the warp beam, heddles, harnesses, shuttle, reed and takeup roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations. With each weaving operation, the newly constructed fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or released from the warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a filling stop motion which will brake the loom, if the weft thread breaks.

[PAR] Picasso’s father was a professor of drawing, and he bred his son for a career in academic art. Picasso had his first exhibit at age 13 and later quit art school so he could experiment full-time with modern art styles. He went to Paris for the first time in 1900, and in 1901 was given an exhibition at a gallery on Paris’ rue Lafitte, a street known for its prestigious art galleries. The precocious 19-year-old Spaniard was at the time a relative unknown outside Barcelona, but he had already produced hundreds of paintings. Winning favorable reviews, he stayed in Paris for the rest of the year and later returned to the city to settle permanently. [PAR] The work of Picasso, which comprises more than 50,000 paintings, drawings, engravings, sculptures, and ceramics produced over 80 years, is described in a series of overlapping periods. His first notable period–the “blue period”—began shortly after his first Paris exhibit.

The protruding end was to be composed of clear glass, shaped to correct vision; however the idea was impracticable, since it would make blinking impossible. [PAR] In 1801, while conducting experiments concerning the mechanisms of accommodation, scientist Thomas Young constructed a liquid-filled \"eyecup\" which could be considered a predecessor to the contact lens.

The direction of movement between atoms is random unless a force causes the electrons to move in one direction. This directional movement of electrons due to an electromotive force is what is known as electricity.

Peugeot could only offer the half-baked 206SW, MG Rover drew a blank and Fiat's Idea was still forming in the Italian manufacturer's mind.

Four engines were offered, 8v and 16v 1.6-litre units and a 1.8-litre petrol powerplant and the pick of the crop, the 1.7-litre CDTi diesel. Four trim levels were offered - the rather cheesily titled Expression, Life, Enjoy and Design.

[PAR] Handel wrote Messiah for modest vocal and instrumental forces, with optional settings for many of the individual numbers. In the years after his death, the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale, with giant orchestras and choirs. In other efforts to update it, its orchestration was revised and amplified by (among others) Mozart .

A near-complete version was issued on 78\\xa0rpm discs in 1928; since then the work has been recorded many times. [PAR] Background [PAR] The composer George Frideric Handel , born in Halle, Germany in 1685, took up permanent residence in London in 1712, and became a naturalised British subject in 1727. By 1741 his pre-eminence in British music was evident from the honours he had accumulated, including a pension from the court of King George II , the office of Composer of Musick for the Chapel Royal , and—most unusually for a living person—a statue erected in his honour in Vauxhall Gardens . [2] Within a large and varied musical output, Handel was a vigorous champion of Italian opera, which he had introduced to London in 1711 with Rinaldo . He subsequently wrote and presented more than 40 such operas in London\\'s theatres. ',\n",

I have watched this series three times, and think it’s one of the best period piece series ever made. Sure, it is from the 1970s, so the production values aren’t what they aren’t anything like today’s slick looks. However, the story line and acting are (in my opinion) much better than most television series. [PAR] Upstairs, Downstairs is yet another dazzling jewel in British period-piece television productions. The show initially ran in the USA on Masterpiece Theatre in the early 1970s. It is set in Edwardian London, and features the life of all who inhabited “165 Eaton Place.” [PAR] The “Upstairs” at this opulent residence consists of an aristocrat family. The Bellamy family hob-nobs with all of England’s wealthy. The patriarch is a member of Parliament, and as such, entertains many of the ruling class. ',\n",

However, Coligny was only wounded, and Charles promised to investigate the assassination in order to placate the angry Huguenots. Catherine then convinced the young king that the Huguenots were on the brink of rebellion, and he authorized the murder of their leaders by the Catholic authorities. Most of these Huguenots were in Paris at the time, celebrating the marriage of their leader, Henry of Navarre, to the king’s sister, Margaret. [PAR] A list of those to be killed was drawn up, headed by Coligny, who was brutally beaten and thrown out of his bedroom window just before dawn on August 24. ',\n",

It was Amis\\' first novel, and won the Somerset Maugham Award for fiction. Set sometime around 1950, Lucky Jim follows the exploits of the eponymous James Dixon, a reluctant medieval history lecturer at an unnamed provincial English university. The tone is often truculent and plain-spoken, but diction and style are wide-ranging and finely modulated. The novel pioneers the characteristic subject-matter of the time: a young man making his way in a post-war world that combines new and moribund attitudes. The book\\'s preliminary pages quote an \"old song\": \"Oh, lucky Jim, How I envy him...\". It is supposed that Amis arrived at Jim Dixon\\'s surname from 12 Dixon Drive, Leicester, the address of Philip Larkin from 1948 to 1950, while he was a librarian at the university. Lucky Jim is dedicated to Larkin, who helped inspire the main character, and who also contributed significantly to the structure of the novel. Time magazine included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005. Christopher Hitchens described it as the funniest book of the second half of the 20th century, and Toby Young has judged it the best comic novel of the 20th century. ',\n",

The Screwdriver sits alongside the better-known Bloody Mary, Moscow Mule and Vodka Martini as one of four classic cocktails that pushed Smirnoff No. 21, and the previously unknown category of vodka, to dominate the global drinking scene.  Before World War II, fresh orange juice was only available in season, while canned juices tasted very different from the real thing. The Screwdriver benefited from new, better-tasting packaged orange juice that arrived in the late 1940s. The name, a carefully masculine title for what could otherwise have been perceived as a feminine drink, supposedly derives from wildcatters drilling exploration oil wells in (variously) California, Texas, Persia or Saudi Arabia. Feeling parched in the desert, the oilmen would stir vodka into their orange juice using the only available tool – a screwdriver. The Screwdriver travelled fast. Creatively promoted in Los Angeles, by 1949 it was on the menus in bars as far afield as Turkey; by the 1960s it was a standard bar call. The key to this classic combination is good quality orange juice, ideally freshly squeezed, which allows the clean taste of Smirnoff No. ',\n",

[PAR] Purpose [PAR] The reason that the country only has one time zone is both practical and political. The Communist party established the country's current time system shortly after it founded the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 to streamline operations, but also to make the country appear more unified. This was a strongly political move, since the country is so large and consists of many regions and ethnic minorities, and it has historically been difficult for one power to effectively rule over all the different areas. It was particularly important to establish authority over the entire country in 1949, as it had been divided by civil war for over 20 years and had gone through a period of fragmentation before that. [PAR] Practical Concerns [PAR] Having only one official time does cause practical problems, especially for people in the western provinces. Beijing is about 3.5 hours ahead of the far Western provinces, meaning that in some cases, the official time is already 10 AM when the sun rises in places like Xinjiang and Tibet. Since many of the people in those provinces are ethnic minorities, they sometimes feel that the use of BST is oppressive and unnecessary. Additionally, many farming communities throughout the country just use their own times, since agricultural work has to be done when the sun is out, regardless of the official time [PAR] Exceptions [PAR] Hong Kong and Macau both use their own time, called Hong Kong Time (HKT) and Macau Standard Time (MST), both of which are Coordinated Universal Time, plus 8 hours (UTC+8). Neither region uses daylight savings time. \",\n",

[PAR] Credit: NASA TV [PAR] A solar eclipse occurs when the moon gets between Earth and the sun, and the moon casts a shadow over Earth. A solar eclipse can only take place at the phase of new moon, when the moon passes directly between the sun and Earth and its shadows fall upon Earth’s surface. But whether the alignment produces a total solar eclipse, a partial solar eclipse or an annular solar eclipse depends on several factors, all explained below. [PAR] The fact that an eclipse can occur at all is a fluke of celestial mechanics and time. Since the moon formed about 4.5 billion years ago , it has been gradually moving away from Earth (by about 1.6 inches, or 4 centimeters per year). Right now the moon is at the perfect distance to appear in our sky exactly the same size as the sun, and therefore block it out. But this is not always true. [PAR] When is the next solar eclipse?

It is predominantly white, but has a variant yellowish appearance when impure. Ascorbic acid is primarily contained in fruits and vegetables, and can be produced naturally by some animals as it is formed from glucose. However, humans and a number of other vertebrates lack the ability to produce it and therefore require it as a dietary supplement, ideally on a daily basis in order to avoid symptoms of its deficiency which include, but are not limited to, inflammation of the gums, decreased resistance to disease-causing agents, scurvy, and high blood pressure.

It is not clear how much light is needed to promote Serpula lacrymans growth. In terms of aeration Serpula lacrymans often grows near ventilation shafts which shows a preference for concentrated oxygen. A moisture content of 30 to 40 percent is its ideal level in wood to promote fruit body formation. It appears that Serpula lacrymans requires an environment where both inorganic and organic materials are present. The fungus uses calcium and iron ions extracted from plaster, brick, and stone to aid the breakdown of wood, which results in brown rot. ',\n",

But between the 15th and 18th centuries, three million sailors are said to have died from scurvy. It was a terrible disease that killed about 70 percent of sailors on each ship. The problem was that no one knew what scurvy was, as the disease was not formally elucidated until 1923. While many animals can make their own vitamin C, human beings must get it from their diet, like citrus fruits, red bell peppers, and organ meats. [PAR] Sailors knew that fresh products, especially orange and lemon juices, cured scurvy. Unfortunately, vitamin C is fragile, and got destroyed by oxidation and heat so it was not available when the sailors needed it most. Amazingly, sailors and their surgeons figured out in 1597 that only fresh lemon juice could prevent scurvy, and that covering it with olive oil instead of heating it, was a better way to preserve it. [PAR] Unfortunately again, this idea got lost for a whole two centuries, until two Scottish surgeons rediscovered that citrus juice could cure scurvy, and that it could be preserved by mixing with alcohol instead of boiling it.

[PAR] Why isn't radar used underwater instead of sonar if radio waves are faster than sound waves? [PAR] Asked by:   Andrew Campbell [PAR] Answer [PAR] Radar is short for ra(dio) d(etecting a(nd) r(anging).  Radar works by emitting pulses of electromagnetic waves toward a target and detecting a small portion of those waves that are reflected back to the receiving antenna.  The transmission and reception is usually done by the same dish-shaped antenna.  The time between transmission and reception is used to calculate the distance to the target by multiplying one-half the round-trip time by the speed of light to get an answer in terms of length. [PAR] Sonar or so(und) na(vigation) r(anging) works in a manner similar to radar, except sonar uses pulses of sound waves underwater to find the distance to a sound-reflecting target.  Since the speed of sound is about 196,000 times slower than light(in sea water), the response time for sonar is proportionately longer. [PAR] Why not use radar underwater?  The catch is that radar uses radio waves in the microwave frequency range, or approximately one centimeter in wavelength. \",\n",

The fact that the repeated line is spoken by Mercutio is absolutely critical to the story as well in that Mercutio is connected to both families either as a relation or a freind.\\xa0 Hence, only Mercutio serves as the social bridge between the two families and now both families have killed that one social bridge.

It can also refer to any \"evil\" that one can use to hurt another person with, therefore, we can think of a plague as a curse (Random House Dictionary). Hence, one thing that Mercutio means when he says, \"A plague o\\' both your houses,\" is that he is cursing their families. We see this curse come true when both Romeo and Juliet later die in the story. As Prince Escalus later points out, God has punished Lords Capulet and Montague for their hatred by taking away what they both loved (V.iii.303-304). [PAR] Since a plague is an infectious disease that causes many deaths, we can also say that through this line Mercutio is pointing out what he already sees as true, that both houses are already cursed due to their hatred and prolonged feud.

Many other stringed and keyboard instruments preceded the piano and led to the development of the instrument as we know it today.

In the ancient world, strings were attached and stretched over bows, gourds, and boxes to amplify the sound; they were fastened by ties, pegs and pins; and they were plucked, bowed or struck to produce sounds. [PAR] Eventually, a family of stringed instruments with a keyboard evolved in Europe in the 14th century. The earliest of these was a dulcimer, a closed, shallow box over which stretched wires were struck with two wooden hammers. The dulcimer led to the development of the clavichord, which also appeared in the 14th century.

His army defeated the Austrians at Mollwitz in April 1741 and overran Silesia. His victory enhanced the suspicion in Europe that the Habsburg dominions were incapable of defending themselves and thus ensured that the war would become general. Within a month France’s Charles-Louis-Auguste Fouquet, comte (later marshal and duc) de Belle-Isle, constructed an alliance with Bavaria and Spain and, later, with Saxony and Prussia against Austria. The Austrian ruler Maria Theresa (daughter of Charles VI) derived her main foreign support from Britain , which feared that, if the French achieved hegemony in Europe, the British commercial and colonial empire would be untenable .

However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania. [PAR] As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.

The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide. [PAR] Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island.

[PAR] In Paris , the Métro (Chemin de Fer Métropolitain de Paris) was started in 1898, and the first 6.25 miles (10 km) were opened in 1900. The rapid progress was attributed to the wide streets overhead and the modification of the cut-and-cover method devised by the French engineer Fulgence Bienvenue. Vertical shafts were sunk at intervals along the route; and, from there, side trenches were dug and masonry foundations to support wooden shuttering were placed immediately under the road surfaces. Construction of the roof arch then proceeded with relatively little disturbance to street traffic. This method, while it is still used in Paris, has not been widely copied in subway construction elsewhere.

There are three primary variants of the Tornado ; the Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike) fighter-bomber, the suppression of enemy air defences Tornado ECR (electronic combat/reconnaissance) and the Tornado ADV (air defence variant) interceptor. [PAR] The Tornado was developed and built by Panavia Aircraft GmbH, a tri-national consortium consisting of British Aerospace (previously British Aircraft Corporation), MBB of West Germany, and Aeritalia of Italy. It first flew on 14 August 1974 and was introduced into service in 1979–1980. Due to its multirole nature, it was able to replace several different fleets of aircraft in the adopting air forces. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) became an export operator of the Tornado in addition to the three original partner nations. A tri-nation training and evaluation unit operating from RAF Cottesmore, the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment, maintained a level of international cooperation beyond the production stage.

D appeared as I ) and M as ( I ). This system allowed powers of ten larger than 1000 to be written by increasing the number of arcs: 10 000 was written (( I )) and 100 000 was written ((( I ))). The Romans had no word for 1 000 000 and rarely considered numbers of that size or larger. In late Roman and medieval times, after D and M were adopted as the symbols for 500 and 1000, a custom arose of writing a bar over a number to multiply that number by 1000.

[PAR] The Carry On films are Britain's longest running film series, comprising 31 films from 1958 to 1992. They are low-budget comedies, featuring a regular troupe of actors, whose humor is based largely on innuendo and double-entendre, with the humor becoming slightly more raunchy as the series progressed. By today's standards however, the jokes are all rather mild and often seem quaint. This is particularly true of Carry On Sergeant, the first film in the series, before the series formula had been perfected. [PAR] British institutions are often the target of the films' humor and here the jokes are aimed at National Service, which didn't end in Britain until 1960. The plot is simple and rather silly, while also being slightly more sentimental than the later films would become. The story takes place over the 10 weeks of basic training for a batch of new recruits in the army, beginning on their first day and ending when they graduate from their training. \",\n",

This newly modified version was probably a response to poor sales of the 'Standard' the previous year, which may in turn have been due to the rising popularity of the more streamlined Stratocaster.  Gibson who have always been quick on the mark when it comes to redesign saw an opportunity to reinvigorate the line and cash in on a modernist shift in ideas, and guitar styles.

All of these associated stars together form the constellation Ursa minor while the 7 brightest stars we recognise form something called an asterism. This is just a fancy word for a pattern of stars.

Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent most of his professional life writing and re-writing Leaves of Grass,  revising it multiple times until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades—the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400.

This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral.

Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.

[PAR] About Saturn's rings [PAR] The rings of Saturn are the most extensive planetary ring system of any planet in the Solar System. They consist of countless small particles, ranging in size from micrometres to metres, that orbit about Saturn. The ring particles are made almost entirely of water ice, with a trace component of rocky material. There is still no consensus as to their mechanism of formation; some features of the rings suggest a relatively recent origin, but theoretical models indicate they are likely to have formed early in the Solar System's history. [PAR] Although reflection from the rings increases Saturn's brightness, they are not visible from Earth with unaided vision. In 1610, the year after Galileo Galilei first turned a telescope to the sky, he became the first person to observe Saturn's rings, though he could not see them well enough to discern their true nature. In 1655, Christiaan Huygens was the first person to describe them as a disk surrounding Saturn. \",\n",

His ideas about childcare influenced several generations of parents to be more flexible and affectionate with their children, and to treat them as individuals.  However, they were also widely criticized by colleagues for relying too heavily on anecdotal evidence rather than serious academic research.  In addition to his pediatric work, Spock was an activist in the New Left and anti Vietnam War movements during the 1960s and early 1970s. At the time his books were criticized by Vietnam War supporters for allegedly propagating permissiveness and an expectation of instant gratification that led young people to join these movements, a charge Spock denied. Spock also won an Olympic gold medal in rowing in 1924 while attending Yale University. ',\n",

[PAR] HOW BOTULINUM TOXIN WORKS [PAR] Botox is very lethal and a small amount of the substance is enough to cause harm to humans. Botulinum toxin is made up of just two ordinary proteins joined together by easily broken chemical bonds—sulfur-to-sulfur bonds between cysteine amino acids in two proteins (Ingraham, p.234). The heavier protein is responsible for seeking and finding the exact spot where nerves contact muscles. When botulinum toxin arrives at this critical junction, a lighter protein that is a protein-destroying enzyme called protease attacks the neuromuscular junction. Consequently, when the neuromuscular junction is destroyed, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine cannot bind to it. Botox works by neuromuscular inhibition of acetylcholine. Without the intervention of acetylcholine, muscle contraction and wrinkles will take place.

       "  'context': 'The first orchestras (in the late 1600s) were mainly string instruments. A pair of oboes was sometimes used to strengthen the first and second violin parts. Soon composers were writing separate parts for the oboe, exploiting its singing tone as a contrast to the violins. The bright, rather penetrating sound of the oboe was easy to hear, and its pitch was more stable than gut strings, so it was natural to rely on it for tuning (One can also imagine it settling, or preventing arguments. Twenty string players squabbling over a tuning note, then asking the oboist to intervene). Other instruments drifted in and out of the orchestra – flutes, bassoon, French horns, clarinets – before its instrumentation became relatively standardized as we know it today. But oboes were almost always present, so they became the standard instrument for tuning. [PAR] There are exceptions. Sometimes a composer chooses to replace the oboes altogether with the mellower clarinets. In that case, the clarinet becomes the de facto tuning instrument. Then there are keyboard instruments like piano, harpsichord or organ. The entire orchestra must tune to them, but the oboe still plays a role. When a keyboard instrument joins the orchestra as either a featured instrument or just a section member, the oboist listens to the ‘A’ played by the keyboard, matches it, and plays it so the rest of the orchestra can hear.
